Input:
       US zip code (only US locations can be used)
UI - should validate input and display errors if the validation fails. The underlying framework should also validate the data before it is submitted for processing.
           
    Processing:
Using value submitted through the UI (button click), the following web services should provide the current weather conditions for a zip code:

Step 1: retrieve latitude/longitude based on the zip code provided:
Google API (Geocoding API to obtain latitude/longitude)
API Documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start
API key: AIzaSyBi6I_cyEBGjPYnKBnCpRvwj6SXx8iVBD8

Step 2: retrieve current weather based on latitude\longitude from the previous call:
Open Weather (Weather API)
API Documentation: https://openweathermap.org/current
API key: 800a3f8dc7a089347269a3957e059ee1

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=43.2987468&lon=-88.38219889999999&appid=800a3f8dc7a089347269a3957e059ee1

Output:
Result of the web service calls:
Success:
1.    UI view describing the current weather for this zip code.
(Up to you how you display the weather conditions)

2.    Create a db record storing results displayed in the UI.
(This data could be displayed again, or used in reports)

Failure:
-    Message in the UI
(Example: “Submitted zip code was not found.”)
